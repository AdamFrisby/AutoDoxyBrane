# AutoDoxyBrane
Autocomplete package generation for ZeroBrane IDE, generated from Doxygen XML output.

## HOWTO

- Generate a Doxygen XML documentation of your corresponding classes using Doxygen as you would normally
- Edit the top of Program.cs to input your configuration (TODO: write a proper configuration system - this goes directly into our build system, so isn't needed)
- The resulting .lua file generated by execution can be added to a 'packages' directory in your ZeroBrane installation, it will then show up under the Interpreters list in the Project menu, and provide autocomplete functionality

Useful for generating autocomplete bindings for people using Lua as a in-game scripting environment.
